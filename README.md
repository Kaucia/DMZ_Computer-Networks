DMZ Implementation README
Overview
This repository contains information and resources related to the implementation of a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) in a network infrastructure. 
A DMZ is a network segment that acts as a secure intermediary zone between an organization's internal network and the external network, typically the internet. 
The purpose of this DMZ implementation is to enhance the security of the network by segregating and controlling the flow of traffic between different zones.
